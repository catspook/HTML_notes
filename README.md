# HTML_notes

These are my notes taken from [The HTML and CSS Book](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/).

The notes are written in HTML. I recommend reading this as displayed in a browser, and then following along in the code (which you can also in the browser).

## Note: 
You will need to input the correct path in line 101 in "notes.html".
